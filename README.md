# NimbleNetwork

The goal of this app was to refine our craft in developing software--to not just stick to original assumptions, regardless of how much friction those decisions cause down the road. Another goal of this project is to push and test your ability to adapt your project as we learn new skills and topics over the course of the rest of the module. Planning, design, and overall user experience of the application are highlighted in this app.

We chose to create a contactlist for users to house information of potential employers, clients, or whatever category of connections desired. Networking is a critical skill, and it can get hard to keep track of everyone you meet when youâ€™re getting established in a new industry. Build an app to help you organize all your contacts.
